## Learning outcomes

<blockquote>
"Learning outcomes describe what students are expected to know, understand or be able to do at the end of a course in order to achieve a passing grade. Course descriptions define learning
	outcomes in terms of knowledge, skills and attitudes to be acquired. From studentsâ€™ point of
	view, the adoption of learning outcomes will shift more responsibility for learning to the
	students themselves. In addition, learning outcomes help students plan their studies, because
	they provide students with explicit information on what is expected of them."
